# How to deploy the AWS Lambda Power Tuning tool

There are 5 deployment options for deploying the tool using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).


1. The easiest way is to [deploy the app via the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR)](#option1). 
1. [Using the AWS SAM CLI](#option2)
1. [Using the AWS CDK](#option3)
1. [Using Terraform by Hashicorp and SAR](#option4)
1. [Using native Terraform](#option5)


Read more about the [deployment parameters here](README-INPUT-OUTPUT.md#state-machine-configuration-at-deployment-time).

## Option 1: AWS Serverless Application Repository<a name="option1"></a>

You can find this app in the [Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:451282441545:applications~aws-lambda-power-tuning) and deploy it with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console.

You can also integrate the SAR app in your existing CloudFormation stacks - check [scripts/deploy-sar-app.yml](scripts/deploy-sar-app.yml) and [scripts/deploy-sar-app.sh](scripts/deploy-sar-app.sh) for a sample implementation.


## Option 2: Build and deploy with the AWS SAM CLI<a name="option2"></a>

**Note**: This method requires Docker.

1. Install the [AWS SAM CLI in your local environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).

1. Configure your [AWS credentials (requires AWS CLI installed)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration):
    ```bash
    $ aws configure
    ```
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
1. Clone this git repository: 
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning.git
    ```
1. Build the Lambda layer and any other dependencies (Docker is required):
    ```bash
    $ cd ./aws-lambda-power-tuning
    $ sam build -u
    ```
    [`sam build -u`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-build.html) will run SAM build using a Docker container image that provides an environment similar to that which your function would run in. SAM build in-turn looks at your AWS SAM template file for information about Lambda functions and layers in this project.
    
    Once the build completes successfully you will see output stating `Build Succeeded`. If the build is not successful, there will be error messages providing guidance on what went wrong.
1.  Deploy the application using the guided SAM deploy mode:
    ```bash
    $ sam deploy -g
    ```
    * For **Stack Name**, enter a unique name for the stack.
    * For **AWS Region**, enter the region you want to deploy in. 
    
    Accept the defaults for all other prompts.
    
    [`sam deploy -g`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-deploy.html)  provides simple prompts to walk you through the process of deploying the tool. The responses are saved in a configuration file, `samconfig.toml`, to be reused during subsequent deployments.

    SAM CLI will run the required commands to create the resources for the Lambda Power Tuning tool. 
    
    A successful deployment displays the message `Successfully created/updated stack`. 
1. To delete Lambda Power Tuning, run
    ```bash
    sam delete
    ```
    Answer `Y` to the prompts.
  

## Option 3: Deploy the AWS SAR app with AWS CDK<a name="option3"></a>

1. [Install AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html).
    ```bash
    $ npm install -g aws-cdk
    ```

1. [Bootstrap](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_bootstrap) your account.

1. [Configure your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration):

    ```bash
    $ aws configure
    ```

1. If you already have a CDK project you can include the following to use the [sam module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-sam-readme.html):

    ```typescript
    import sam = require('@aws-cdk/aws-sam');
    
    new sam.CfnApplication(this, 'powerTuner', {
      location: {
        applicationId: 'arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:451282441545:applications/aws-lambda-power-tuning',
        semanticVersion: '4.3.4'
      },
      parameters: {
        "lambdaResource": "*",
        "PowerValues": "128,256,512,1024,1536,3008"
      }
    })
    ```

Alternatively, you can build and deploy the solution from the source in this repo. See the following pages for language-specific instructions.
    
  ### TypeScript
See the [Typescript instructions](cdk/typescript/README.md)
    
  ### Python
See the [Python instructions](cdk/python/README.md)
  
  ### go

### C\#
See the [Csharp instructions](cdk/csharp/README.md)

## Option 4: Deploy the SAR app with Terraform<a name="option4"></a>

Simply add the `aws_serverlessapplicationrepository_cloudformation_stack` resource below to your Terraform code and deploy as usual through `terraform apply`.

```hcl
resource "aws_serverlessapplicationrepository_cloudformation_stack" "lambda-power-tuning" {
  name             = "lambda-power-tuner"
  application_id   = "arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:451282441545:applications/aws-lambda-power-tuning"
  capabilities     = ["CAPABILITY_IAM"]
  # Uncomment the next line to deploy a specific version
  # semantic_version = "4.3.4"

  parameters = {
    # All of these parameters are optional and are only shown here for demonstration purposes
    # See https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning/blob/master/README-INPUT-OUTPUT.md#state-machine-input-at-deployment-time
    # PowerValues           = "128,192,256,512,1024,2048,3072,4096,5120,6144,7168,8192,9216,10240"
    # lambdaResource        = "*"
    # totalExecutionTimeout = 900
    # visualizationURL      = "https://lambda-power-tuning.show/"
  }
}
```

See the [Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/serverlessapplicationrepository_cloudformation_stack) for more configuration options of `aws_serverlessapplicationrepository_cloudformation_stack`.

If you don't yet have a Terraform project, check out the [Terraform introduction](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html).

## Option 5: Deploy natively with Terraform<a name="option5"></a>

The Terraform modules are located in the [terraform](terraform) directory. Deployment documentation is [here](terraform/Readme.md).
