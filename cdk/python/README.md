# How to deploy the AWS Lambda Power Tuneing using the CDK for Python

This CDK project deploys *AWS Lambda Power Tuning* using Python.

You can use the project as a standalone or reuse it within your own CDK projects.


## CDK Prerequisites

See [here](../README.md).


## Language specific prerequisites

- [Python 3.6 or later](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites)
- [Requirements for CDK with Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html)

## Building, testing, and deploying the app

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are on Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

cdk synth
pytest
cdk deploy


```
